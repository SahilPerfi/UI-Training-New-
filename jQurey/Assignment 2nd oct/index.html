                <p>Health care (also health-care or healthcare) is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields. Medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training, and other health professions are all part of health care. It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.
                <p>Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies. Providing health care services means "the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes".[2] Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographic barriers (such as additional transportation costs, the possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services), and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers, poor health literacy, low income).[3] Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).</p>    
                <p>Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism, a well-trained and adequately paid workforce, reliable information on which to base decisions and policies, and well-maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies.</p>
                <p>An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country's economy, development, and industrialization. Health care is conventionally regarded as an important determinant in promoting the general physical and mental health and well-being of people around the world.[4] An example of this was the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980, declared by the WHO as the first disease in human history to be eliminated by deliberate health care interventions.[5]</p>
                <p>Demographic characteristics mean consumers’ age, income, social and economic background, gender, size of their family, ethnicity, religion, culture, education level, job type, social class, and nationality. Marketers collect all of such information through a survey, telephonic interviews, and from the local public office where such information is easily available.</p>
                <p> Not only they collect data, but they also study each part in detail. Then they also create different ranges like; age would be 18 to 25, 33 to 45, 55 to 65, or +65. Their income would fall between 15000 to 25000 Rs, or +50000, which tell us their social class.</p>        
                <p> purpose of collecting well-detailed information is to target precisely those segments of the market. For instance, telephonic calls and SMS packages would interest the young market falling in the age from 18 to 25.</p>

                    <h2>Consumer Markets</h2>
                <p>The consumer market comprises of those people who are the end-users and they don’t resell the product or service any further. We see products and consumers everywhere in the market.</p>
                <p> Whenever a person buys a product, then he becomes a part of the consumer market. We can categorize the whole consumer market into four types; retail, transportation, food, and beverages (drinks). Buyers usually make their own decisions whenever they want to buy something in the market.</p>
                <p>Marketing and advertising play a very significant role in influencing the buying decision of the consumers; it tells them which product to choose by educating them about the product. When it comes to choosing the product, people prefer brand products because of the loyal. Brand loyalty doesn’t just happen; marketers do a lot of research to find relevant information about their market and then target them through TV ads and other promotional activities.</p>
                <p>The consumer market is completely different from the business market because of the difference in the marketing strategy. Marketers divide the consumer market into different segments depending upon the characteristics, demographics, and behavior and psychographic of the consumer. After dividing the market into different segments, they target the interest, likes, and dislikes opinion and values of the consumers. </p>
                <p>For instance, when you buy some food or drink form the grocery retail store, then you’re doing an activity of the consumer market.</p>
                <p>The consumer market is comprised of consumers, and when they keep consuming products and services. The businesses flourish because of it; the economy of the country grows as a result. In simple words, when people spend products, then producers and entrepreneurs produce and deliver more products in the market. As a result, the running cycle of production and consumption contributes to the national economy of the whole country.</p>
                <p>Demographic characteristics mean consumers’ age, income, social and economic background, gender, size of their family, ethnicity, religion, culture, education level, job type, social class, and nationality. Marketers collect all of such information through a survey, telephonic interviews, and from the local public office where such information is easily available.

                <h2>Automotive</h2>
                <p>The automotive industry began in the 1860s with hundreds of manufacturers that pioneered the horseless carriage. For many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production. In 1929, before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the U.S. automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time, the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons.[4] After 1945, the U.S. produced about 75 percent of world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and then became world leader again in 1994. In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production and held this rank until 2009, when China took the top spot with 13.8 million units. With 19.3 million units manufactured in 2012, China almost doubled the U.S. production of 10.3 million units, while Japan was in third place with 9.9 million units.[5] From 1970 (140 models) over 1998 (260 models) to 2012 (684 models), the number of automobile models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.[6]</p>
                <p>Early car manufacturing involved manual assembly by a human worker. The process evolved from engineers working on a stationary car, to a conveyor belt system where the car passed through multiple stations of more specialised engineers. Starting in the 1960s, robotic equipment was introduced to the process, and today most cars are produced largely with automated machinary.[7]</p>
                <p>Safety is a state that implies being protected from any risk, danger, damage, or cause of injury. In the automotive industry, safety means that users, operators, or manufacturers do not face any risk or danger coming from the motor vehicle or its spare parts. Safety for the automobiles themselves implies that there is no risk of damage.</p>
                <p> Safety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated. Automobiles and other motor vehicles have to comply with a certain number of regulations, whether local or international, in order to be accepted on the market. The standard ISO 26262, is considered one of the best practice frameworks for achieving automotive functional safety.[8]</p>
                <p>In case of safety issues, danger, product defect or faulty procedure during the manufacturing of the motor vehicle, the maker can request to return either a batch or the entire production run. This procedure is called product recall. Product recalls happen in every industry and can be production-related or stem from raw material.</p>
                <p>Product and operation tests and inspections at different stages of the value chain are made to avoid these product recalls by ensuring end-user security and safety and compliance with the automotive industry requirements. However, the automotive industry is still particularly concerned about product recalls, which cause considerable financial consequences.</p>
